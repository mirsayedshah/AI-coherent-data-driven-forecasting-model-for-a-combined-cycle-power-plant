Appendix 1
The proposed numerical calculation of Python's CCPP optimum generation capacity.
The provided code assumes that the input variables consist of a single set of four optimum input variables. By using multiple input datasets, the system performance and output efficiency can be evaluated accordingly. Advanced methods such as loops or vectorization can be employed for this purpose.
